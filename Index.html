			<h2></h2>
			<p1><i>A small biography</i> </p1>
			<p1>Coming from a Spanish mother and an Argentinian father, I was born the Saturday 5th December of 1998 in Perpignan, France, with a twin brother. I have a sister as well who is a year older than us. We had a fantastic childhood 
			in the small village of Sant Hilari Sacalm. I was the kind of kid that never studied and had remarkable results. <hr> Most of my childhood I spent it playing videogames such as Dofus or Call of Duty.
			Another big part of my childhood was spent just enjoying it: hanging out with friends, riding the bike, skateboarding, going to the pool...  I also did basketball, drama, artistic
			roller-skating and played chess in the school club. I was the 7th best chess player in Catalonia when I was 12 years old. <hr>
			After I finished highschool I had my worst 4 years in my life, at university. I lived just to study, and to be honest, I am not a good student. I had never studied in my life until I started my bachelor's degree.
			I am a pragmatic person so to learn and have real, lasting knowledge I must apply what I am learning on a blackboard. These 4 years of study could be summed up in a rush of engineering subjects not giving enough 
			time to retain everything on your brain so that you end up with a lot of superficial knowledge. Knowing a tiny something about everything. <hr> On November 2019 I saw the awful truth about studies. Even if you work hard enough, it does not matter, 
			university is NOT going to help you more than just posting a poor "job oportunity" website that has been designed without love in a matter of minutes. Where is the link then between students and real world?
			the link is on traineeships. <hr> On February 2020, just before the Covid-19 hit Europe I had the honour and pleasure to join Eurocontrol as a trainee. Right now I am in the Surveillance unit (NMD/INF/CNS which means
			Network Manager Directorate/INFrastructure/Communication Navigation and Surveillance), dealing with data analysis from all kind of surveillance systems.<hr>
			but mainly dealing with Mode S. </p1>
			<p1><i>Personality</i> </p1>
			<p1> I define myself as a curious and optimistic person. I prefer to work alone than with people, and I appreciate loneliness a lot. I thrive for the sense of nothingness that you can get travelling to remote places or doing freediving.
			
			My favourite music is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHoT4N43jK8">this one.</a>
			and now I should add a small resume for myself.		 </p1>
