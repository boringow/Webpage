			<h2><i>A small biography</i></h2>
			<p1>Coming from a Spanish mother and an Argentinian father, I was born the Saturday 5th December of 1998 in Perpignan, France, with a twin brother. I have a sister as well who is a year older than us. We had a fantastic childhood 
			in the small village of Sant Hilari Sacalm, we spent countless hours playing chess and lots of videogames. <hr> I started working at 17 years old as a receptionist in Platja d'Aro. I can speak catalan, spanish, english and french fluently. Right after finishing highschool at my hometown,	
			I joined aerospace systems engineering at UPC in Castelldefels, near Barcelona. I graduated from there the 11th April 2021. The uni experience was probably the worst of my life. I'm not a good student, as I am a pragmatic person and we barely had practical lessons in there.<hr>
			On February 2020, just before the Covid-19 hit Europe I had the honour and pleasure to join Eurocontrol as a trainee. Right now I am in the Surveillance unit (NMD/INF/CNS which means
			Network Manager Directorate/INFrastructure/Communication Navigation and Surveillance), dealing with data analysis from all kind of aeronautical surveillance systems.<hr>
			The 16th April 2021, 1 month and a half before my traineeship ends, I got accepted in ATOS, Eurocontrol's main contractor, to start working full-time in June as a Business Analyst. My first work experience in the field I like!</p1>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2><i>Personality</i> </h2>
			<p1> I define myself as a curious and optimistic person. When something bad happens to me I focus on what can I do to improve the situation and move forward, without 
			overthinking or getting stuck in the negativity. Overthinking is probably the worse trap humans turns themselves into. Luckily, my brain automatically avoids that. 
			Also, I consider myself a really perseverant person, if I want something I will achieve it no matter what. <hr>
			My humour is a bit different more different than usual. Life should always be taken with a pinch of humour, even on the worst moments.
			Two values I appreciate a lot in people are discipline and social consciousness. It seems that those two are also the ones that lack the most among nowadays society, or at least from my point of view.
			I appreciate loneliness a lot. I thrive for the sense of nothingness that you can get travelling to remote places or doing freediving.
			I have an extrange but strong comfortable feeling when it rains heavily and I am listening the rain from home. Seawater is warmer when it rains by the way and there is nothing that seawater cannot heal.<hr>
			A pair of useful lifehacks I would tell the world is that if you put shaving cream on any glass makes it demisting/defogging and that milk cleans ink from any piece of cloth.
			My favourite music is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHoT4N43jK8" target='blank'>this one.</a> Stromae is the best artist of all the times, appart from stromae's music I love techno, electronic music, swing and some french rap.
