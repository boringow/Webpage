			<h2>September 2022</h2>
			<p1>
				I decided to start a master in management at <a href="https://www.vub.be/en" target="blank">VUB</a>. <br><br>
				The decision was taken to mix my knowledge in engineering with social sciences.
				Society encourages people having masters, and every time more and more a master is easier to get. It's my turn now to get it, let's see what do I learn from it.

			<h2>June 2022</h2>
			<div class="imagecontainer"><img class="object-fit-cover" src="./media/saotome_web/SaoTome1.jpg"></div>
			<p1>Sometime back in 2019, while working in Centervol's CAMO, a helicopter came inside a container from Sao Tome e Principe. I never heard the name of that country, but when I googled it, I discovered the most amazing place in the planet. <br><br>
				As an enthusiast of remote places, I decided to take a flight there the first time I receive a double pay. That happened on December 2021 and I bought a plane ticket from 28/05/2022 to 11/06/2022. <br><br>
				I am well aware that a website must be graphic and too much text is a killer of the narrow attention-span the average human has. That's why I will try to keep it short and show some images about the trip.

			<h2>March 2022</h2>
			<div class="imagecontainer"><img class="object-fit-cover" src="./media/Flyin_Web.jpg"></div>
			<p1>I just joined a flying club in Saint Ghislain to learn how to fly an airplane. Prices are democratic and my instructor, Damien, holds 7.000 flight hours.

		<h2>Summary of the year:</h2>
			This year, I learnt:
			<ul>
				<li> Working experience is way more valuable than university studies.
				</li>
				<li> How to create a website.
				</li>
				<li> That many people are in a relationship because they cannot be alone.
				</li>
				<li> To do a backflip.
				</li>
				<li> That most adults are kids in grown up bodies.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>May 2021</h2>
		<p1>Everyone's life is shaped with all decisions you decide to take or not take.
		<br>
			 Right before my traineeship ends at Eurocontrol, I got offered a nice position as an ATSEP at the Ireland Aviation Authority at the same time they offered me to continue working as a contractor at Eurocontrol. <br><br>
			 Although the salary in Ireland is a bit higher, I decide to continue at Eurocontrol because of one main reason: I do not want to focus already in a single field on the vast world of aviation. Within Eurocontrol's data services team 
			 I have the opportunity to work with different units at the same time, getting a broader picture of the whole aviation ecosystem.

		<h2>February 2021</h2>
		<p1>I created this webpage to learn a bit about web developing and web hosting. It is quite simple and it will serve as a small auto-biography, where I dump my thoughts and life-experiences in here.</p1>
